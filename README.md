# üè† Hex Management



**Hex Management** is a modern **real estate management platform** built with [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/), and [**BetterAuth**](https://github.com/BetterAuth). It streamlines **property lifecycle management**, **investment tracking**, and **team collaboration** in a secure, role-based environment.

üè† **Property Listings** ‚Äî Create and manage properties with images, descriptions, and *advanced pricing metrics* to calculate optimal **rental**, **lease**, or **sale** values.
üë• **Organizations & Roles** ‚Äî Structure access with organizations where employees cannot create independent orgs. Govern with role-based permissions: `owner`, `admin`, `member`.
üí¨ **Real-Time Chat** ‚Äî Communicate inside the platform with live chat between organization members, direct 1:1 messages, and auto-generated **group chats** for properties with **external investors**.
üìß **Investor Onboarding** ‚Äî Invite investors via secure **email verification** powered by [**Resend**](https://resend.com/), with access codes and onboarding flows.
üí≥ **Subscriptions** ‚Äî Powered by [**Stripe**](https://stripe.com/) for **Free**, **Deluxe**, and **Premium** tiers, ensuring secure billing and protection of sensitive user information.
üîó **Future-Proofing** ‚Äî Planned support for **account linking**, letting users connect and manage multiple accounts under a single profile.
üì¢ **Notifications & Engagement** ‚Äî Built-in notifications, role management, and investor engagement keep teams and stakeholders aligned.
‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Storage** ‚Äî Store property images with **Supabase Storage** (with a planned migration to **Amazon S3** for scale).

‚ú® With integrated **chat**, **subscriptions**, **investor flows**, and **role-based access**, `Hex Management` unifies **real estate management**, **collaboration**, and **investment operations** into one powerful platform.

In the future, the platform will include an **AI-powered pricing engine** to automatically generate the best rates based on property data and market trends.
